<h1> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JayArD27 </h1>
I'm an aspiring frontend developer and UI/UX designer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I'm passionate about creating beautiful and user-friendly interfaces and I have a keen eye for detail. I'm committed to designing interfaces that are intuitive and visually appealing, and my experience in PHP allows me to create designs that function seamlessly. I also enjoy illustrating in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, and I believe that a strong understanding of color, composition, and aesthetics is essential for creating effective designs. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue developing my skills in frontend development and UI/UX design.
